# Project 2: CS3265

Set-Up Instructions:

Step 1: Move this folder of files into Applications -> MAMP -> htdocs

Step 2: Set up the database by first running the 'databaseSetUp.sql' file.
Note that due to the sheer size of this database (9 million unique rows), this set-up
can take approximately 30 minutes.

Step 3: Add the advanced features to the database by running the 'features.sql' file

Step 4: Ensure that the conn.php file is looking at the correct database

Step 5: Start the connection and view in http://localhost:8888/parkingdata/index.html
Safari is strongly recommended, as the full UI does not appear with some versions of Chrome.

Step 6: The front-end should feature a black background with a silhouette of the New York skyline.
See that and you've set it up correctly!
